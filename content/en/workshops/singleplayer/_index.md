## Who is the ACROSS Single-player Workshop for?

This is a self-guided version of the [group ACROSS workshop](/workshop/multiplayer), designed for individuals to complete on behalf of their community and project. This option could be chosen by single core maintainers, for example. 

If you are a group wanting a collaborative workshop experience with multiple people, go to the [multiplayer version](/workshop/multiplayer)
