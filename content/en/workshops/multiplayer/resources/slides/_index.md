There are a number of resources that are hosted as Google Workspace files: the faciliator slides, and the worksheet. 

## Facilitator Slides

The ACROSS Workshop slides can be found at [bit.ly/across-workshop-slides](https://bit.ly/across-workshop-slides). 
 
 * **Make a copy** of these slides: [bit.ly/across-workshop-slides-copy](https://bit.ly/across-workshop-slides-copy).
 * Update the slides: 
    * Add your name, photo, pronounts to the "Friendly faces who make this workshop work" slide. 
    * Update all `[PLACEHOLDER]` references. 
    * Adjust the "Agenda" slides based on your [workshop timing](/workshops/multiplayer/timeline/day-of-workshop/#workshop-timing).

## Best Practices for working with Google Workspace files
