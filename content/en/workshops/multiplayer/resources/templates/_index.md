## Notetaker Guidance


<table><tr><td>
Subject: ACROSS Workshop - Notetaker Guidance
</tr></td><tr><td>
Thank you for agreeing to be a notetaker for an ACROSS Workshop! Your recorded observations will be critical to ensuring the success of ACROSS. 

For the ease of participants, we will not be making recordings of any workshop, so it is your duty to ensure record keeping for the event. 

Workshop plan: 

* Please review the [ACROSS Workshop Playbook] before your workshop to understand the structure of the session that the Facilitator will drive.
* We have asked participants to speak slowly, avoid acronyms, and to listen to each other
    * If you are confused about any terms, be the person to say "Excuse me, I don't understand what that term means". 

How to capture:

* Use a Google doc to ensure revisions are captured. 
* Ensure you capture
    * Group participants and date
    * Details on the four sections of discussion
    * Details on the retrospective

What to capture: 

* Discussions
    * These have been marked in the template per the agenda 
* Retrospective discussion
    * This is paramount to ensure that future workshops can learn from the outcomes of earlier workshops, and can be adjusted if required.

What will be captured for you: 

* Attendees & Affiliation 
    * This was captured when participants volunteered. This is a collaborative effort, so assigning quotes/ideas to people is not required
* Each breakout group will be capturing their own notes. 
    * When the groups collect back, ensure a copy of these notes have been gathered (probably their own Google docs, with revision history)

What not to capture: 

* Any comment or note from a participant noted as "Off the record", "In Confidence", or otherwise flagged as being off the record.
* Your interpretation of what was said. We appreciate that you may have opinions on what was discussed, and if you wish to capture those, please do so in a way that is distinguishable from participants/transcript-like notes. We want to ensure that the _source_ is captured, not the _interpretation_, as this may lead to lossy information.
