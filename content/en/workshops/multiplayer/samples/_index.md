## Template Contribution Guide

<code>rocksoft.eco/contribute</code>

**Contributing to Rocksoft**

Rocksoft is managed by Rockcorp, but welcomes contributors from everyone!

For first time contributors, we've created this guide to help you work out where your skills can be best applied. 

New Engineering: 

* Rocksoft uses Gitlab as source control and bug tracking. Bugs marked with "good-first-issue" are good candidates for newer contributors to assess. 
* Pull requests are processed through our testing system, and we use [bot name] to check for various machine-checkable fixes (linting, formatting, etc). Pull requests requires two approvals per pull request, including at least one from our [current release manager] for new features.

Tutorials and guides:

* We would love to feature your use cases of Rocksoft! See our [tutorial guide] for how to get your tutorial listed in our documentation.

Testing: 

* We are always after people to try out our alpha releases of new versions of Rocksoft. If you encounter issues, please ensure you mark your version with the output of `rocksoft --info` to help our team identify if you're on an alpha release.
