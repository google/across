The <a href="https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/partner/OCEAN/">OCEAN (Open Source Complex Ecosystems and Networks) Project</a>
 stems from an unrestricted gift from the Google Open Source Programs Office to the Vermont Complex Systems Center.
Our research partners are using this gift to build a community-oriented body of research focused on understanding how open source platforms are used and what makes technology-rich environments thrive. 
ACROSS is a part of this work.
