The Open Source Complex Ecosystems and Networks ([**OCEAN**](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/partner/OCEAN/)) Project stems from an unrestricted gift from the [Google Open Source Programs Office](https://opensource.google/) to the [Vermont Complex Systems Center](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/). Our research partners are using this gift to build a community-oriented body of research focused on understanding how open source platforms are used and what makes technology-rich environments thrive. ACROSS is a part of this work.

## Goals

The Attributing Contributor Roles in Open Source Software (**ACROSS**) virtual workshops are designed to:

* Bring folks together from an open source community to identify what kinds of work and activities create, sustain, and foster their project
* Help projects improve how they identify and recognize their contributor community
* Improve the overall visibility of the work needed to maintain open source communities

In these workshops we will walk you through a process to identify the work that is being done, then help you create or improve your existing documentation to make that work visible.
