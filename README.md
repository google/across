This repository contains code and related content for the ACROSS Taxonomy Project, including Workshops and Research, as part of Project OCEAN. 

## [Project OCEAN Overview/Goal](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/partner/OCEAN/)
Project OCEAN is an open science collaboration focused on understanding the open source ecosystems creating datasets that enable research and forming a clear understanding of the state of open source communities. OCEANâ€™s goal is to understand the health of the open source communities.


## [ACROSS](https://bit.ly/across-workshop-community-pitch)
The ACROSS workshops allow open source communities to create and publish community-generated contribution documentation for open source ecosystems, clarifying who is present in open source and the impact they have.

For future updates on new work and more ACROSS opportunities, please join our mailing list [across-opensource-workshops@](https://groups.google.com/g/across-opensource-workshops).

## Local development

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a Ruby-based static site generator. 

Deployment previews are automated with [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (see comments automatically added to new PRs).

It uses GitHub Actions `.github/publish.yaml` to generate static content that is served by the Settings > Pages setting. 

For location development, with a [Ruby installation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and [bundler](https://bundler.io/guides/getting_started.html): 

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve -lo
```
