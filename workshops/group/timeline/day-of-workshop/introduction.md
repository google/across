This section is ground rules and scoping. It contains a short set of slides around the scoping of why this identification process is important, and introduces the facilitators to the participants, and participants to each other.

_Suggestions_:

* during "Participatory Refinement and Questions", ask "What questions do you have?", rather than "Do you have any questions?".
