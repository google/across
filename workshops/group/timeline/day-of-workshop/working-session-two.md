title: "Working Session #2 - Ideate, Group, Classify"
---

Using the definition from the previous session, this session focuses on coming up with a sample descriptive **CATALOG OF CONTRIBUTIONS**.

Remember the example defined earlier: Community, Value, Outcome.

_Suggestions:_

* There is no right answer to any questions in this session, or workshop. 
* If your project **already** has a contribution scheme, try flipping the script:
    * Can you identify anyone who works on your project who isn't currently attributed as a contributor? 
    * What are less-common tasks that are performed? 

#### Presentations of Work #2

Give each breakout group five minutes to present their results, and ten minutes to discuss with the workshop as a whole.
