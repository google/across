The slides and speaker notes for the workshop itself are very open and explicit, and this "Day of the workshop" offers additional meta information. It is _highly recommended_ you review the [slides and speaker notes](/workshops/multiplayer/resources/slides/) well ahead of the workshop. Links to skip to each section of the workshop are available on Slide 3 of the Facilitator Deck.

## Workshop timing

**One half day, or separate sessions?**

The workshop itself is broken into four working sessions or modules, and are designed to be delivered in order, with small breaks, or on separate days. If choosing separate days, combine Introductions and Working Session #1, and Working Session #4 and Retrospective.

## Workshop size?

**Many breakout groups, or none**

This workshop can be completed with between 3 and 12 participants, in 1 to 4 breakout groups. If you have only one breakout group, look for notes tagged "Small group" for suggestions. Otherwise, this playbook presumes there will be more than one breakout group. If you have fewer than three people, it may be more useful to complete the self-guided workshop (see "Who is this workshop for").
