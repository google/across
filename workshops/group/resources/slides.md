There are a number of resources that are hosted as Google Workspace files: the faciliator slides, and the worksheet. 

## Facilitator Slides

The ACROSS Workshop slides can be found at [bit.ly/across-workshop-slides](https://bit.ly/across-workshop-slides). 
 
 * **Make a copy** of these slides: [bit.ly/across-workshop-slides-copy](https://bit.ly/across-workshop-slides-copy).

## Best Practices for working with Google Workspace files
