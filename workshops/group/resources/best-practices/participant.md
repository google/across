title: "Best Practices for Participating in Inclusive Workshops"

Your facilitator will be [following a number of best practices](facilitator/). These notes are based on your involvement in the workshop. 

**Review the agenda, resources, and all other workshop materials ahead of time.** This sets the stage for everyone to have access to the same information, and process it when they need to.

**Every working session will be started with introductions that include names and pronouns.**

**Ground rules on collaboration features.** It will be established in the beginning of each working session how the group wants to use chat channels, breakout rooms, and when is the best time to ask questions of a speaker. For example:

 * Do you want to use the "raise hand" feature in your meeting platform as a queue, or does that make other people feel interrupted?
 * What multi-sensory and platform features will facilitators use to signal to a speaker that their allotted time is complete?
 * What multi-sensory cues can the participants use for turn taking?
 * Does everyone understand how to mute their mic when they are not speaking?
 * Where and how should people respond to questions?

**Remember your background and allow others their privacy.** Virtual backgrounds can be distracting or bandwidth intensive. It's not okay to comment on someone's appearance or that of their environment and is counter to the goals of this workshop.

**Plan for call-in participants for remote workshops.** Sharing documents, meeting notes, and any slides used ahead of time allow people to participate fully when a secure internet connection is not reliably available. 

If anyone's bandwidth is impacted by video conferencing, consider having everyone turn off their camera with only the speaker keeping their camera on.

**The platform chosen will be one that enables the most accessible communication with your team.** If known ahead of time the technology that is planned on being used for the virtual meeting, chat, and document sharing, feedback on availability of accessibility features will be provided.

**Create space for those participants who have shared less or been quiet by saving time to ask for additional input**. You won't be put on the spot by being called on directly, unless the group has agreed to this ahead of time as a norm. Help keep a shared document with a "questions and comments" section for those who process information by writing.
