&lt;p>The mascot of OCEAN is Salty the Sea Otter, as featured on a few of the slides. &lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/otter/">ðŸ¦¦ U+1F9A6 OTTER&lt;/a> was added to Unicode 12.0 in 2019.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your operating system has not had major updates since that time, you may have issues viewing some title slides in the deck. If required, you can remove the emoji from the deck by editing the &amp;ldquo;Section&amp;rdquo; template and removing the placeholder.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
