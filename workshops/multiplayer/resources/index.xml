Subject: ACROSS Workshop - Thank you for participating!
&lt;/tr>&lt;/td>&lt;tr>&lt;td>
Hello!
&lt;p>Thank you for the time you&amp;rsquo;ve spent working through the ACROSS Workshop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are grateful for your participants, and would like to share the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>[Useful outcomes]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>[Any FYI action items]&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>[YOUR NAMES]&lt;/p>
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;h2 id="notetaker-guidance">Notetaker Guidance&lt;/h2>
&lt;table>&lt;tr>&lt;td>
Subject: ACROSS Workshop - Notetaker Guidance
&lt;/tr>&lt;/td>&lt;tr>&lt;td>
Thank you for agreeing to be a notetaker for an ACROSS Workshop! Your recorded observations will be critical to ensuring the success of ACROSS.
&lt;p>For the ease of participants, we will not be making recordings of any workshop, so it is your duty to ensure record keeping for the event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Workshop plan:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Please review the [ACROSS Workshop Playbook] before your workshop to understand the structure of the session that the Facilitator will drive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have asked participants to speak slowly, avoid acronyms, and to listen to each other
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you are confused about any terms, be the person to say &amp;ldquo;Excuse me, I don&amp;rsquo;t understand what that term means&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>How to capture:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use a Google doc to ensure revisions are captured.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ensure you capture
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Group participants and date&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Details on the four sections of discussion&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Details on the retrospective&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>What to capture:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Discussions
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>These have been marked in the template per the agenda&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Retrospective discussion
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This is paramount to ensure that future workshops can learn from the outcomes of earlier workshops, and can be adjusted if required.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>What will be captured for you:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Attendees &amp;amp; Affiliation
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This was captured when participants volunteered. This is a collaborative effort, so assigning quotes/ideas to people is not required&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each breakout group will be capturing their own notes.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When the groups collect back, ensure a copy of these notes have been gathered (probably their own Google docs, with revision history)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>What not to capture:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Any comment or note from a participant noted as &amp;ldquo;Off the record&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;In Confidence&amp;rdquo;, or otherwise flagged as being off the record.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your interpretation of what was said. We appreciate that you may have opinions on what was discussed, and if you wish to capture those, please do so in a way that is distinguishable from participants/transcript-like notes. We want to ensure that the &lt;em>source&lt;/em> is captured, not the &lt;em>interpretation&lt;/em>, as this may lead to lossy information.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table></description></item><item><title>Workshops: Fictional Project Samples</title><link>/workshops/multiplayer/resources/samples/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/workshops/multiplayer/resources/samples/</guid><description>

&lt;p>We are looking for organizers to help make this event happen! Please use [this application form] to register your interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Organizers will have full access to the event, and travel dispensation (up to 500 clams, 1000 for international travelers).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Current opportunities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Program reviewers
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Rockconf receives more than 300 talk submissions annually, and we need help reviewing these submissions.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Timeline: Dec 2027 - Feb 2028&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Work: reviewing submissions, discussing selections with Program Chair&lt;/li>

&lt;p>We are a few weeks away from Rockconf 2028, and we&amp;rsquo;re seeking volunteers to help us with on-site activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All these activities are on-site work. They require physical participation, but should not take more than 1 day of the four day event. With many volunteers, we can distribute the work so that even our volunteers can enjoy some of the presentations and events!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Accepted volunteers will be provided with access to the event (including meals and access to all talks and workshops) (or a refund if you&amp;rsquo;ve already paid), and travel dispensation (up to 200 clams, 400 for international travelers).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Current volunteer opportunities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Session chairs:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Work: Help introduce speakers, present timekeeping cards to help speakers not go over time, facilitate questions and answers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Time required: 2 x 3 hour session blocks&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Room monitors:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Work: Ensure speakers find their presentation rooms, notify green room should issues exist outside the ability of the session chair to assist.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Time required: 2 x 3 hour session blocks&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Contributing to Rocksoft&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rocksoft is managed by Rockcorp, and welcomes contributors from anyone!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For first time contributors, we&amp;rsquo;ve created this guide to help you work out where your skills can be best applied.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New Engineering:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Rocksoft uses Gitlab as source control and bug tracking. Bugs marked with &amp;ldquo;good-first-issue&amp;rdquo; are good candidates for newer contributors to assess.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pull requests are processed through our testing system, and we use [bot name] to check for various machine-checkable fixes (linting, formatting, etc). Pull requests require two approvals, including at least one from our technical advisory group for new features.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Tutorials and guides:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We would love to feature your use cases of Rocksoft! See our [tutorial guide] for how to get your tutorial listed in our documentation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Testing:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We are always after people to try out our alpha releases of new versions of Rocksoft. If you encounter issues, please ensure you mark your version with the output of &lt;code>rocksoft --info&lt;/code> to help our team identify if you&amp;rsquo;re on an alpha release.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>More here! Some of these prompts use the &amp;ldquo;We value&amp;rdquo; statements from Working Session #1!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
